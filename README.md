# Gigante NPK Experiment — Throughfall, Litterfall, and Foliar Nutrient Analyses

This repository contains R analysis scripts and processed data from the Gigante NPK Experiment, a long-term nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilization study in old-growth tropical forest in central Panama. The datasets include foliar nutrient concentrations, litterfall mass and nutrient fluxes, and canopy throughfall chemistry used to evaluate fertilization effects on nutrient cycling.

- Analysis scripts: see `/scripts/README.md`
- Data documentation: see `/data/README.md`

Reproducibility: this project uses `{renv}`. Run `renv::restore()` to recreate the package environment.
